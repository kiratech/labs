# Lab | Create a new user in your local OpenShift

---

1. As user `kubeadmin` check the oauth default configuration for crc.
2. Identify the secret associated with the default authentication.
3. Download the secret to a local file using `oc extract`.
4. Add a user using 'htpasswd' and push the newly created file to the secret.
5. Check if you can login (you should not) and create the crc user so that
   you'll be able to login properly.
