# Lab | Customize a Deployment on OpenShift

---

1. Create a yaml or json file containing Deployment specifications. You can
   obtain a prepared yaml to explore use oc-new app with yaml output:

   ``` console
   > oc new-app mariadb MYSQL_USER=user MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass MYSQL_DATABASE=testdb -l db=mariadb -o yaml > mariadb-deployment.yaml
   ```

2. Explore the yaml: you can customize it before creating the resources on
   OpenShift.
   There are 3 different resources defined in this yaml:
   - ImageStreamTag: provides a metod to keep an image in the OpenShift
     internal registry synced with an external registry;
   - Deployment: which keep informations about how Pods are composed, how many
     replicas, and when to react to changes;
   - Service: a method to expose applications outside the OpenShift cluster.
     We will explore Services in further chapters;

3. Customize the Deployment resource to add a label "zone: dmz" and ensure
   at least 2 replicas of the Pods. Also remove the Service part;

4. Create the resources on your OpenShift cluster with ```oc create```;

5. Observe the results;

6. Delete all the resources using the specific tag "zone: dmz" created above;
