# Lab | Use ImageStreams to perform updates and rollback of a DeploymentConfig

---

1. As developer create a new project named `testdeploy`.
2. Create an ImageStream named `webserver`, and import as `webserver:1.19-perl`
   the image coming from `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1.19-perl` into it,
   tagging it also `latest`.
3. Create and expose a `DeploymentConfig` by using `oc new-app` command with the
   specific `--as-deployment-config` option, naming it `webserver` and getting
   the image from the image stream `webserver:latest`.
4. Check the automatically created trigger inside the `DeploymentConfig` named
   `webserver`.
5. Import into the `webserver` ImageStream the `1.20-perl` image, tagging it as
   `latest`, and look if the trigger is executed.
6. Import into the `webserver` Image Stream the `1.21-perl` image, tagging also
   this new one as `latest`, and look if the trigger is executed.
7. Look at the rollout history and rollback the deployment its first iteration.
