# Lab | Explore current SCC and add more permissions to a deployment

---

1. As `kubeadmin`, look at available SCCs and explore some details (like
   `anyuid`, `privileged` and `restricted`).
2. As `developer` try deploying a new app inside a new project named `scc-test`
   based on a container which require root privileges (like the `nginx:latest`
   docker-image).
3. Show logs and see why the pod can't run.
4. Create a new ServiceAccount named `useroot`.
5. As `kubeadmin` use the `add-scc-to-user` policy to add `anyuid` SCC to
   `useroot` service account.
6. Then, as `developer`, edit the `nginx` deployment to add `useroot` as
   `serviceAccountName` attribute inside `spec:template:spec:` attribute;
7. Check the new status of the deployment and look at logs to show if pods are
   running correctly;
