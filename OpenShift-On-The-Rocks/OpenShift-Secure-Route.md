# Lab | Create a secure route

---

1. As `developer`, create a new project named `route-test` and deploy a new
   app named `testroute` based on the nginx container image.
2. Check the app status.
3. Create a key and a certificate to expose your site.
4. Define an **edge** Route named `nginx`. Let OpenShift generate the hostname
   by itself.
5. Test the secure connection via browser or curl.
