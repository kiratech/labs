# Lab | Exposing your application

---

1. As developer, deploy mariadb and tomcat applications into the project
   `expose-test`.
2. Verify if the DeploymentConfig, Pods and Service are up and running.
3. Expose both applications.
4. Verify that both applications are reachable. Is it true? Understand why just
   'tomcat' can be reached and find out a way to expose mariadb.
5. Cleanup everything.
