# Exercise | Containers Environment Variables

1. Pull and run the "nginx" container image with the name "environment-var-test" passing the environment variable MESSAGE with the value of "Test content".

2. Log into the container and check that the content of the MESSAGE variable is what you set during the launch.

3. Exit the shell and enter again the shell, this time overriding the MESSAGE variable with a new value, say "Modified test content".

4. Exit again the shell and log once again without overriding the variable, checking the content of the variable.

5. Was the value changed? What does this mean?
