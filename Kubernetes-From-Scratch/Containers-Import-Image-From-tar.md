# Exercise | Containers Import Image From tar

1. Download and uncompress the tar image named
   [Containers-Import-Image-From-tar.nginx-saved-container.tar.xz](https://github.com/mmul-it/training/raw/master/Kubernetes-From-Scratch/Containers-Import-Image-From-tar.nginx-saved-container.tar.xz)

2. *Load* the saved image into the docker registry;

3. Run a container starting from this image, exposing port `8080` and note what
   is different from a usual nginx;

4. Download and uncompress now the tar named
   [Containers-Import-Image-From-tar.nginx-exported-container.tar.xz](https://github.com/mmul-it/training/raw/master/Kubernetes-From-Scratch/Containers-Import-Image-From-tar.nginx-exported-container.tar.xz)

5. *Load* the image, what happens?

6. Now try to *import* the image, what happens?

7. Finally try to run a container based on this image, is this possible? Can you
