   B. Applying the same configuration multiple times results in the same state
   C. Applying configuration manually
   D. Ensuring configurations are never applied more than once
4. Which practice is essential for managing changes in IaC?
   A. Manual updates
   B. Direct changes to live environments
   C. Version control

5. What is Continuous Integration (CI)?
   A. A method to perform manual tests
   B. A practice of merging code changes frequently and automatically testing them
   C. A technique for configuring servers manually

   B. Using declarative syntax
   C. Automating configurations
   D. Defining the exact steps to achieve a state
8. Why is automated testing important in a CI pipeline for IaC?
   A. To manually verify each change
   B. To slow down the deployment process
