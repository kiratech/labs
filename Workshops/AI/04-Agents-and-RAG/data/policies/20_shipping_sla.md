# Shipping & SLA (SLA-200) — v1.0
Covers shipping, delivery SLAs, late-delivery vouchers, lost shipments, signature requirements, and B2B caps. Use for SLA-* references, voucher caps, and determining whether a shipping issue qualifies for compensation.

## Delivery targets (SLA-2xx)
- [SLA-201] Standard: 3–5 business days (domestic). International: 5–8.
- [SLA-202] Express: 1–2 business days (domestic).

## Late delivery vouchers (SLA-21x)
- [SLA-211] ≥ 2 business days late: 10% voucher.
- [SLA-212] ≥ 5 business days late: 20% voucher.
- [SLA-213] ≥ 10 business days late: free shipping credit + 25% voucher.
- [SLA-214] **Voucher cap €50 per order** (consumer).
- [SLA-215] Customer must contact us within 14 days of delivery for a voucher claim.

## Exclusions (SLA-22x)
- [SLA-221] Force majeure, severe weather, customs holds, customer unavailable, wrong address by customer → **no voucher**.

## Loss & Signature (SLA-23x)
- [SLA-231] Confirmed loss by carrier: full refund **or** free reshipment.
- [SLA-232] Orders > €500 require signature unless customer **opts out**; signature opt-out → **no loss voucher**, but [SLA-231] still applies.

## B2B note (SLA-24x)
- [SLA-241] Palletized shipments tolerance: +2 business days before SLA vouchers apply.
- [SLA-242] For B2B, voucher **cap €250 per PO** (unless contract/SOW overrides).

## Escalation (SLA-25x)
