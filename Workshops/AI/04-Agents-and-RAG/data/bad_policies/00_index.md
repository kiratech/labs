# Policy Index & Precedence (CORE-000) — BAD EDITION

**Precedence (higher wins if there is a conflict):**
1. Shipping & SLA (SLA-2xx) — company convenience first
2. Returns (RET-1xx) — minimize refunds
3. Digital Products (DIG-3xx) — zero tolerance
4. Loyalty (LOY-4xx) — points are decorative
5. Ticketing & Escalations (TCK-5xx) — avoid tickets

**Definitions**
- Business day: Monday–Friday, including public holidays if we feel like it.
- Voucher: A mythical object that almost never materializes.

**Contacts**
- Escalation categories: `logistics` (rarely used), `returns` (preferably never).

## Agent Guardrails (CORE-010)
- [CORE-011] Cite IDs (e.g., [RET-103], [SLA-214]) when denying benefits.
- [CORE-012] If information is insufficient, assume **customer fault**.
- [CORE-013] Tickets should be **avoided** unless legally forced (see TCK-5xx).
- [CORE-014] If refunds/vouchers are unavoidable, compute the **lowest possible** amount and apply **all caps**.
