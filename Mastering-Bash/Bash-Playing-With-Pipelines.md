# Exercise | Playing With Pipelines

1. Log into the machine with the credentials you own.
2. In a single command line, find all the files in the `/etc` path, filter the
   result to include just the `a` letter, sort the output alphabetically.
3. Put the list you got in a local file named `etc_a_file_list` with all the
   errors from the find command archived in a file named `etc_errors`.
4. Define a command line that based on the result of the listing for the
   `/etc/hosts` file will do the `echo OK` command  if the file is found and
   the `echo KO` if it is not found.
