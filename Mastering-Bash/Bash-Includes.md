1. Log into the machine with the credentials you own.
2. Create a file named `myfunctions1` that will contain a function printing this
   simple text: `This is my first function`.
3. Create a file named `myfunctions2` that will contain a function printing this
   simple text: `This is my second function`.
3. Create a file named `myfunctions.sh` that will include the two libraries and
   call sequentially the two functions.
