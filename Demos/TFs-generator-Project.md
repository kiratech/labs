# Demonstration | The TFs generator project

This demonstration is about [TFs generator](https://github.com/mmul-it/tfs_generator)
an open-source Ansible role, available on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/mmul/tfs_generator/)
that takes an Ansible inventory and, by using Ansible templates, generates
Terraform manifests for two cloud providers:

- [Libvirt](https://github.com/mmul-it/tfs_generator/blob/main/Libvirt.md)
- [Azure](https://github.com/mmul-it/tfs_generator/blob/main/Azure.md)

This is a real life scenario where Ansible and Terraform work together, each
technology doing what it does best.
